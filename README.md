## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing and computer vision. This project leverages computer vision to detect and classify emotions from facial expressions in images.

## Features
- Emotion detection from images
- Pre-trained models for emotion classification
- Easy-to-use interface for testing and evaluation

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdadnanafzal/Sentimental-analysis-using-CV.git
cd Sentimental-analysis-using-CV
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the emotion detection model, use the following command:

```bash
python TrainEmotionDetector.py
```

You can also test the model on your own images by running:

```bash
python flow.py --image_path path_to_your_image
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled images with various facial expressions. Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format before running the training script.

## Model
The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, pre-trained on a large dataset of facial expressions. The model is fine-tuned for emotion classification.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in detecting and classifying emotions from facial expressions. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the `results` directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue.
